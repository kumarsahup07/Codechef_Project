## 📚 Projects Overview

### 1. 📋 To-Do List App
A command-line based app to manage daily tasks. You can add, view, and delete your tasks.
- **Skills Used**: Lists, file operations, user input
- **Use Case**: Basic personal task manager

---

### 2. 🧮 Word Counter
A Python script that takes text or a file and counts the frequency of each word.
- **Skills Used**: Strings, file reading, dictionaries
- **Use Case**: Text analysis, word frequency stats

---

### 3. ❓ Quiz Game
A fun quiz game played in the terminal with multiple-choice questions and scoring.
- **Skills Used**: Conditional logic, loops, scoring system
- **Use Case**: Educational or fun practice quizzes

---

### 4. 📇 Contact Manager
A simple CRUD system to manage contact records (name, phone, email) stored in a CSV file.
- **Skills Used**: File handling, record searching/updating
- **Use Case**: Contact book for small teams or personal use

---

### 5. 🏪 Inventory Management System
Manage product stocks: add, view, update, delete products stored in `inventory.csv`.
- **Skills Used**: Dictionaries, CSV handling, input validation
- **Use Case**: Product tracking for shops or businesses
- ✅ **Note**: Output file `inventory.csv` can be encrypted using **Project 7** for added security.

---

### 6. 🎓 Student Database Manager
Manage student records (Roll No, Name, Age, Course, Department) with text file storage.
- **Skills Used**: Text file parsing, data validation, search & update
- **Use Case**: School/college student record system
- ✅ **Note**: Output file `students.txt` can also be encrypted with **Project 7** to protect sensitive data.

---

### 7. 🔐 File Encryption Tool
Encrypt and decrypt any file using the `cryptography` library (Fernet symmetric encryption).
- **Skills Used**: File I/O (binary mode), encryption key generation, exception handling
- **Use Case**: Secure any `.txt` or `.csv` file — perfect for protecting data files like:
  - `inventory.csv` from Project 5
  - `students.txt` from Project 6

---

## 🔒 Real-World Use Case

By combining Projects 5, 6, and 7:
- You can **store structured data** in CSV or TXT format
- Then **encrypt these files** to secure confidential records like:
  - Student info
  - Product inventory
- This simulates basic data protection workflows found in **real-world data handling and cleaning**.
